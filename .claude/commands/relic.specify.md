# /relic.specify

> **Before proceeding:** Read `.relic/preamble.md`. It defines where artifacts belong.
> Violating those rules cannot be undone by a changelog entry.

## Before you begin — Step 0: derive the spec title

Read the user's input (description, PRD snippet, or user story).
Extract a short, clear feature name — 2–4 words, title case, no punctuation.
Examples: "User History", "Checkout Flow", "Auth Token Refresh".

## Before you begin — Step 1: scaffold the spec

```bash
relic scaffold --title "<derived title>"
```

This generates the spec ID, creates the folder, and writes empty scaffolding for
`spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, and `artifacts.json`. Use the `spec_id` from the
JSON output for all subsequent file references — do not infer it from anywhere else.

You are helping create a new spec for this project.

## Before you begin — Step 2: load context

1. Read `.relic/constitution.md` — understand the governing rules.
2. Read the newly created `spec.md` from the path in the scaffold output.
3. Discover relevant shared artifacts using the two-step cascade:

   **Step A — targeted search (preferred):**
   From the user's input, extract up to 10 keywords (domain terms, entity names, technical concepts). Run:
   ```bash
   relic search <keyword1> <keyword2> ...
   ```
   Read the returned entries. For candidates with a high `score`, read the full artifact file.
   If the results cover the domain well enough to identify overlaps and dependencies, stop here.

   **Step B — full brain scan (fallback, only if Step A is insufficient):**
   ```bash
   relic deep-search
   ```
   Read only the `tldr` field of each entry. Identify which artifacts are relevant to this spec,
   then read those full files. Do not read all files indiscriminately.

## Your task

The user will provide a PRD, user story, or verbal description of the feature.
Help them fill in `.relic/specs/{{SPEC_ID}}/spec.md`.

### Steps

1. Write a clear **Overview** paragraph: what this feature does and why it exists.
2. Extract **Functional Requirements** (what the system must do) and
   **Non-Functional Requirements** (performance, security, constraints).
3. Write **User Stories** in the format: *As a [role], I want [capability] so that [benefit]*.
4. Define **Scope** — what is explicitly in scope and out of scope.
5. Identify **Shared Artifacts** this spec should own or read:
   - Use `relic search <keywords>` to find existing artifacts by domain terms before scanning directories directly.
   - Propose new shared artifacts where needed.
   - Do NOT claim ownership of an artifact already owned by another spec.
6. Update `artifacts.json` with the correct `owns`, `reads`, and `touches_files` arrays.
7. Flag any open questions in the **Open Questions** section.

## Intersection check

Before writing `artifacts.json`, check:
- Which files will this feature touch (`touches_files`)?
- Do any existing `specs/*/artifacts.json` files claim `owns` of the same files or artifacts?
- If yes, flag the conflict in **Open Questions** — do NOT claim conflicting ownership.

## What NOT to do

- Do not create a `plan.md` — that is the `plan` step.
- Do not write code.
- Do not modify shared artifacts owned by another spec.

## When done, confirm

- `spec.md` is complete and clear.
- `artifacts.json` is populated with correct `owns`, `reads`, `touches_files`.
- Any intersection concerns are flagged in Open Questions.
